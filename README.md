## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage  

1. Start your Stable Diffusion API server locally (ensure it‚Äôs accessible on `http://127.0.0.1:port`).  
2. In Unreal Engine, call `SetRequestAddress` with the correct port to configure the API endpoint.  
3. Use `GenerateImage` to send a payload with your desired parameters:
   
   ```cpp
   FSDiffusionPayload Payload;
   Payload.Prompt = "A futuristic cityscape at sunset";
   Payload.Width = 1024;
   Payload.Height = 1024;
   Payload.Steps = 75;
   USdiffusionUFunctionLibrary::GenerateImage("http://127.0.0.1:7860/sdapi/v1/txt2img", Payload);
   ```  
5. Listen for the `OnImageGenerated` delegate to retrieve the generated image's path and status.  
6. Optionally, use `DecodeImage` to load the generated image as a `UTexture2D` for use in your project.

## üì¶ Example Blueprint  

You can also use **SdiffusionUE** in Blueprints! Here's how:  
- Call `SetRequestAddress` to set the API URL.  
- Use the `GenerateImage` node to send the payload.  
- Bind to the `OnImageGenerated` delegate to handle the results.

| **Height**        | Height of the image                | `512`          |  
| **Steps**         | Number of sampling steps           | `50`           |  
| **CfgScale**      | Guidance scale                     | `7.0`          |
